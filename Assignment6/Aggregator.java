public class Aggregator {
    //The Aggregator class maintains references to the Menu object and the Orders object. It should provide a getter method for retrieving the Menu and Orders objects (no setters are needed). The Menu and Orders classes store a collection of MenuItem and OrderItem objects, respectively. A MenuItem object will store the menu item #, the description, and its cost. An OrderItem object will store an order by its item number only (not its description).
