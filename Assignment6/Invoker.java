// TODO: A tab will be constructed from the Tab class containing all of the ordered items, returned as an array of strings for the user interface to display. Note that a tab needs information from both the Menu and the Orders objects. (The Orders object indicates what menu items were ordered, and the Menu class has the description of each item to include in the Tab.)
